cifar10_classification
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 different classes: airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. The goal is to build an accurate model that can predict the class of an input image from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

CIFAR-10 Image Classification Using CNNs
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 different classes: airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

Problem Statement
CIFAR-10 is a dataset that consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The goal is to classify these images into their respective categories using a deep learning model.

Data Source
The dataset can be downloaded from the CIFAR-10 page.
